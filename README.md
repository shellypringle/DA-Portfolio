**Harnessing the power of data to make more informed decisions**

## About Me:
Science Teacher turned Analyst! I have an MS in Biology and was an educator for 13 years. Over the course of my career I have developed a love for all things data, and am currently seeking a role in which I can pursue this passion. Below are some sample projects I have worked on to hone my analytics skills:

## Projects:
### SQL projects
These are projects where exploratory analysis was done on different databases, with the purpose of asking and answering questions with data.
All analysis was performed in SQL (using PostgreSQL or BigQuery).

### Tableau projects
These are projects where exploratory analysis and visualization was done via Tableau.
