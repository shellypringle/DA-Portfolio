That which is measured improves. That which is measured and reported improves exponentially.

## About Me:
Data Analyst working in long-term disaster recovery and disaster mitigation for the State of Texas. Former educator.
Skilled in analytical tools (Excel, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau), information architecture, project management, training, and the distillation/communication of complex ideas to a diverse audience. Below are some sample projects I have worked on to hone my analytics skills:

## Projects:
### SQL projects
These are projects where exploratory analysis was done on different datasets, with the purpose of asking and answering questions with data.
All analysis was performed in SQL (using Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL or BigQuery).

### Tableau projects
These are projects where exploratory analysis and visualization was done exclusively via Tableau.
